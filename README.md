# Data-Analytics-Process
Application in Real life Scenario Case Study 


# PROBLEM STATEMENT

Description: We use Data Analytics in everyday life without even knowing it. For eg: Going to a market to buy something.

PLAN We first decide which things I need before going to market. Is it a shirt, jeans, footwear etc? PREPARE Next I need to check how much I am willing to spend and how to get that money. PROCESS Then I need to check how much I want from the data. Like if I am going to buy footwear what do I want - slippers/shoes/sandals etc? ANALYSE You obviously won't buy things which are out of trend, Also you need to check does the jeans which you have and the color of the T-shirt you want to buy, will make a good combination. SHARE Now you communicate your idea to the shopkeeper to find the best suitable fit for you. ACT Then you finally buy it.


YOUR TASK:
Your task is to give the example(s) of such a real-life situation where we use Data Analytics and link it with the data analytics process. You can prepare a PPT/PDF on a real-life scenario explaining it with the above process (Plan, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act) and submit it as part of this task.
